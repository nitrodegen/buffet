how does vector embedding work? 

you have your image.
and then classes with possible similar features
like your image.

find them.


How to find similar  X with info that X belongs to second class (K) 
  
np.mean would work right? 

but really and actually, no.

What can work is just substracting pixels i guess and finding mean num of those.

BUT OUR MODEL HAS TO ACTUALLY PREDICT SMTN RIGHT?
